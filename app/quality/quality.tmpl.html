                        100 translation different in levels and styles will be delivered.
                        For you to receive translation matching your request, it is recommended for you to consider following aspects.

                            →By understanding whether the document is for researchers, adult or children, and male or female, the translator can choose proper writing style.

                        <li><strong>02. Notify a translator the image the translation should be about.</strong>
                            →By understanding your image or hope about translation, the translator can try to meet your request more closely.
                        </li>
                        <li><strong>03. Notify a translator glossaries and related sites<br /></strong>
                            →By referring to glossaries and related sites, the translator can have deeper understanding about the document.
                        </li>
                        <li><strong>04. Choose translation level<br /></strong>
                            →At Trans-Pro., you can choose one from three levels, "Light," "Business," and "Expert" depending on quality level.
                            Translators are grouped into these three levels based on their experience and customers' evaluation.
                            Please note that if you choose short delivery time, it becomes more likely for the translator to make mistakes because he/she does not have enough time to read the translation over again.
