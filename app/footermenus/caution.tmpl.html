                        The first priority for our staffs is <strong>the skill of their mother language.</strong>
                        <br> Necessary issues include the skill to examine the original language using tools such as dictionaries,
                        <br> understand the language over time, and writing abilities.
                        <br> It is important how you translate the original text you understand into your own language.
                        <br> It is also necessary to use expressions that fit the target reading and the client's needs.
                        <br>
                        <br> Note that although it is necessary for manuals to be understandable, it is more important to tell the
                        <br> information truthfully in the case of certificates.
                        <br> What's <strong>important is the skill of expression</strong>, not substituting the words.

                    <p class="Text">
                        Always obey the format set by the client while working.
                        <br> Translations may vary from published books to in-house documents.
                        <br> Obeying the format is extremely important when unifying texts divided to separate translators.
                        <br> Flexibility is required to write in the appropriate font and match with the translation by other translators.
                        <br> Note that there are situations where you might be required to proceed differently than usual due to the client's request.
                        <br>
                        <br> In the case of no instruction, you can still earn a higher evaluation as a staff by asking the format which the client requests.

                        <br> Notify the customer if the original text contains mistakes or parts you cannot understand.

                        Careless mistakes usually are overlooked during proofreading.
                        <br> These mistakes are different from obvious mistakes and can be easily overlooked.
                        <br> For example, in Japanese translations, teams with same pronunciation and similar characters, conjunctions,
                        <br> and forgetting to erase periods are careless mistakes that often occur.
                        <br> On the other hand, spelling mistakes that spell check cannot detect, such as "the" and "he", are common in English translations.
                        <br> Always be cautious to make precise sentences and <strong>use methods such as reading out loud</strong>, or <strong>check by printing the document out</strong>, to reduce careless mistakes. Be aware of careless flaws such as partial untranslation.
