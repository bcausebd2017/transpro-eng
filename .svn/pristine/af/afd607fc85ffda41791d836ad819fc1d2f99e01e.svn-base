            <div class="order-breakdown-wrap receive-msg-wrap common-sub-block penalty" style="overflow-x:auto;">
                <p>Penalty is imposed if there are mistakes in the translation. Although mistakes tend to occur due to translation being a human task, it is the translator's responsibility to reduce mistakes to the least before delivering it to the customer.</p>
                <h3 class="txt2">The penalties for translation mistakes are listed as below.</h3>
                <p>Translators with 3 penalty points will be put into a black list, and cannot receive or accept any order. Translators on the black list will not be put off the list until they improve and earn enough creditability as a translator, judge by b-cause.</p>
