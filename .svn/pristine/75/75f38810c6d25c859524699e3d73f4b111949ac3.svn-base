                            →By referring to glossaries and related sites, the translator can have deeper understanding about the document.

                            →At Trans-Pro., you can choose one from three levels, "Light," "Business," and "Expert" depending on quality level.
                            Translators are grouped into these three levels based on their experience and customers' evaluation.
                            Please note that if you choose short delivery time, it becomes more likely for the translator to make mistakes because he/she does not have enough time to read the translation over again.
