                            Basically there will be no refunds after the payment is done. If you sent the wrong documents please contact our office immediately. We will handle it as soon as we confirmed the situation, but we cannot refund if the translation is already finished.
                            In the case of poor quality, you may interact with the translator as many times as you wish within 2 weeks after delivery. However, due to the translator's schedule, there may be a possibility that they cannot fix it as you wish.
